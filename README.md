# Quiz App

### This is a React and TypeScript web application that allows users to take a quizz and earn tokens. The app is built on Next.js and uses React Query for state management. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Requirements

:white_check_mark: The app must be connected to a Metamask wallet.
:white_check_mark: The app must ensure that the user is connected to the Goerli network.
:white_check_mark: The app must show the balance of the $QUIZ token.
:white_check_mark: When the page is loaded, the app must present the title of the daily trivia with its picture and a button that allows the user to begin answering the questions.
:white_check_mark: Once the survey starts, the app must display the current question, which will be available for the amount of seconds specified in the lifetimeSeconds property.
:white_check_mark: Whether or not the user answers the question, the app must move onto the next question.
:white_check_mark: Once all the questions are finished, the app must show an overview of all the answers.
:white_check_mark: The app must have a button that allows the user to submit the answers to the validator contract.
:white_check_mark: The app must refresh the balance of the $QUIZ token.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you will need to:

Install Node.js and npm.
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Run the app by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Resources

In addition to the tech requirements, I used **Web3 library** to make interactions with the smart contract (which I extracted from [blockchain-challenge-utils Github Repo](https://github.com/rather-labs/blockchain-challenge-utils/blob/main/abi.json)).

Also I used **Sand API** to create an endpoint that returns the survey data (JSON can be found in app/utils/survey.json), as a way to mock an API call and be able to use some of the React Query functionality.
